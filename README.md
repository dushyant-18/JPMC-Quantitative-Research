JPMorgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research Virtual Experience Program

This repository contains my submissions for the JPMorgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research Virtual Experience Program. The tasks cover a range of topics from commodity price analysis to credit risk modeling, demonstrating key quantitative research techniques in Python.

Table of Contents

Task 1: Investigate and Analyze Price Data
Objective: Analyze historical natural gas prices and extrapolate future prices using a regression model.
Key Techniques: Data analysis, linear regression, polynomial regression, data visualization.

Task 2: Price a Commodity Storage Contract
Objective: Develop a pricing model for a natural gas storage contract, considering multiple factors such as injection/withdrawal rates, storage costs, and market prices.
Key Techniques: Contract pricing, time series analysis, financial modeling.

Task 3: Credit Risk Analysis
Objective: Build a predictive model to estimate the probability of default (PD) for loan borrowers, and calculate the expected loss on a loan.
Key Techniques: Logistic regression, decision tree classification, expected loss calculation, model evaluation.

Task 4: Bucket FICO Scores
Objective: Implement a quantization method to bucket FICO scores into discrete categories, optimizing for log-likelihood and minimizing mean squared error.
Key Techniques: Dynamic programming, quantization, log-likelihood optimization, mean squared error minimization.

Requirements
